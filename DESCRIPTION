Description: This package can create bin lists from Bruker 
    NMR spectra and perform basic processing steps. 
    The function negTrafo() replaces negative values by
    small values in the noise range, preserving the order 
    of values. mrbinGUI() lets the user set parameters, 
    mrbin() performs the follwoing operations: Reading NMR 
    files, creating bins, removing solvent area, removing 
    additional user-defined areas, summing up bins that 
    contain instable peaks such as citric acid, removes 
    noise bins, crops HSQC spectra to the diagonal area,
    performs PQN scaling, replaces negative values, log 
    transforms and displays a PCA plot. Parameters are 
    saved in a file and can be restored using 
    recreatemrbin().
