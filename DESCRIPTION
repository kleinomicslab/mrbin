Description: A collection of functions for processing and analyzing metabolite data. 
    The namesake function mrbin() converts 1D 
    or 2D Nuclear Magnetic Resonance data into a matrix of values suitable for further data analysis and
    performs basic processing steps in a reproducible way. Negative values, a
    common issue in such data, can be replaced by positive values (<doi:10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00684>). All used
    parameters are stored in a readable text file and can be restored from that
    file to enable exact reproduction of the data at a later time. The function fia() ranks features according
    to their impact on classifier models, especially artificial neural network models.
