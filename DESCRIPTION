Description: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is widely used in Life Science
    research. This package converts 1D or 2D data into a matrix of values
    suitable for further data analysis and performs basic processing steps in a
    reproducible way. Negative values, a common issue in such data, are replaced
    by positive values. All used parameters are stored in a readable text file
    and can be restored from that file to enable exact reproduction of the data
    at a later time.
