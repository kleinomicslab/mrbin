\title{A function for summing bins.}
\usage{
sumBins()
}

{None}

\description{
This function sums up bins. The sums are saved to the middle (median) bin of

for signals that are know to vary between spectra due to pH or salt content,
such as citric acid. Intended for use within the mrbin function.
