\title{A function for summing up bins.}
\usage{
sumBins()
}
\value{
{None}
}
\description{
This function sums up bins. The sums are saved to the middle (median) bin of
the original area. All other bins of the area are removed then. This is handy
for signals that are know to vary between spectra due to pH or salt content,
such as citric acid.
